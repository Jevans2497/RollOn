# RollOn

RollOn is a physics based puzzle game I created. The goal of the game is essentially to get a blue ball into a goal, often with the help of other types of balls that have unique effects (bomb ball blows up on click, ghost ball can go through objects, etc.) In the end, I hope to have >50 levels total where every 10 levels introduces a new ball, currently at ~15 unique and challenging levels. 

Also, every level is confirmed beatable. The original 10 levels are extremely challenging but it is 100% possible to beat them.
